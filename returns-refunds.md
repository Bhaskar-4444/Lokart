1. Eligibility for Returns

Defective Products: Items that are spoiled, contaminated, or do not meet FSSAI quality standards at the time of delivery (e.g., rotten vegetables, expired dairy).
Damaged Products: Items damaged during transit (e.g., crushed fruits, broken packaging).
Incorrect Products: Items delivered that do not match your order (e.g., wrong type or quantity).

1.2 Non-Perishable Products

Non-perishable items (e.g., spices, oils, dry goods) may be returned if unused, unopened, and in their original packaging, provided the return request is made within 7 days of delivery.

1.3 Non-Eligible Items

Perishable Products: Items such as fresh vegetables, fruits, and dairy are not returnable unless defective, damaged, or incorrect, due to their perishable nature.

Provide Details: Include your order number, a description of the issue, and photos of the product (if applicable) to help us verify the reason for the return.

Processing: Approved returns will be processed within 7-10 business days from the date we receive the returned product or confirm the issue.

3. Refund Process
3.1 Eligibility for Refunds

Refunds are issued for:
Defective, damaged, or incorrect products.
Cancellations made before dispatch, as per our Terms of Service.
Non-delivery due to Vegrasâ€™ error.


Refunds are not issued for:
Custom Orders or bulk orders unless defective or incorrect.
Perishable items that spoil due to improper storage post-delivery.
Orders refused without a valid reason (e.g., non-defective products).



3.2 Refund Method

Refunds will be issued to the original payment method (e.g., UPI, bank transfer, credit/debit card) used for the order.
For B2B clients with credit terms, refunds may be credited against future invoices, subject to mutual agreement.
Refund processing takes 7-10 business days after approval, depending on your bank or payment provider.

3.3 Refund Amount

Refunds cover the product cost and applicable taxes (e.g., GST). Delivery charges are refunded only if the entire order is defective or incorrect.
Partial refunds may be issued for partial returns (e.g., specific items in a multi-item order).

4. Delivery-Related Returns

Non-Delivery: If an order is not delivered due to our error, contact us within 24 hours of the expected delivery time. We will reschedule delivery or issue a full refund.
Failed Delivery: If delivery fails due to an incorrect address or unavailability of an authorized recipient, you may incur additional delivery charges for redelivery. Perishable items may not be redelivered if they risk spoilage.
Inspection: Inspect all products upon delivery and report issues immediately to qualify for returns or refunds.

5. Special Considerations for B2B Clients

Bulk Orders: Hotels, mess, PGs, and restaurants returning bulk orders must provide detailed documentation (e.g., photos, batch numbers) to verify defects or discrepancies.
Coordination: We may arrange returns during scheduled deliveries to minimize disruption to your operations.
FSSAI Compliance: Returned products must comply with FSSAI standards for safe handling. Vegras is not responsible for improper storage or handling by B2B clients post-delivery.
Credit Adjustments: For approved returns, B2B clients may opt for credit adjustments against future orders instead of cash refunds, subject to agreement.

6. Return Shipping

For defective, damaged, or incorrect products, Vegras covers return shipping costs and may arrange pickup.
For non-defective returns of non-perishable items, you are responsible for return shipping costs unless otherwise agreed.
